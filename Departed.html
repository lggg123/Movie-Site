        <p>The story takes place in a setting with Lionardo Di Caprio as the main character he is a South Boston cop that is going undercover to inflitrate the organization of gangland chief Frank Costello. Scorsese does a great job at making The film a classic gangster film filled with suspense which is played by Leonardo Di Caprio. We can see everyone believes Leonardo is a real criminal until the end. Also Matt Damon plays a great law enforcement official in the film as he changes the structure of it</p>
